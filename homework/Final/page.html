        A Multiverse is hypothetical group of multiple universes out there. The universe is ever expanding

        hence, there has been a hypotheses that we are not the only universe out there and rather there are

        ore than one and we simply live in one of the many. Together the universes comprise of everything

        that exists whether it'd be space, time, dark matter, energy, and the physics that are used to

        describe such hypothetical scenarios. 


        It all first began in Dublin in 1952, a researcher named Erwin  Schrodinger gave a lecture -- 
        
        a lecture which in the end where its listeners deemed him an absolute lunatic when he gave his 

        then nonsensical and other worldly hypothetical scenario. He proposed that his equations seemed 

        to describe several different histories, "these were not alternatives, but all really happen

        simultaneously."


        The term multiple universes was coined "multiverse" in 1895 by American Philosopher and Psychologist,

        William James.

        In 2010, scientists, one of them being Stephen M. Feeney analyzed data from a probe. The probe

        was called WMAP - Wilkinson Microwave Anisotrophy Probe. They claimed to find evidence that

        our universe collided with other universes once ago long in the past. We called this type of

        collision a bubble universe collision. But the evidence came back null as there was no type of

        significant evidence such as gravitational pull of space time fabric to prove that the bubble 

        universe collision indeed had occured.


        NASA has stepped up to the topic of the Universe once before. In the early 1990's, NASA was 

        fairly certain about the expansion of the universe although not the multiverse. Space has 

        enough dark energy and dark matter to continuously expand and recollapse. In 1998, the Hubble

        Space Telescope observed a distance supernovae that gave evidence that the universe has actually

        been accelerating more than they thought. Even to this day, we are still unsure of how to explain

        this expansion or what is causing it.

        Around 13.7 billion years ago, everything that we came to take knowledge about began with what

        we know as the Big Bang Theory. The Big Bang theory is basically the theory on how our universe

        came to be. It began with what was a small singularity that continuously inflated over the next

        13.8 billion years. An unknown trigger caused the universe to expand and inflate in a three-

        dimensional space. This immense energy filled trigger cooled down and light began to come 

        through. Small particles began to form bigger particles, asteroids slamming into small 

        planetismals to create other small planetismals. 

        Eventually that's how our galaxies, stars, and planets came to form. Earth is situated in what

        we know as the goldilocks zone where the highest chances of life through the universe we know

        may come to exist. The Universe continuously expands yet we don't know what the shape of space

        time exactly is. If the universe infinity? Are there bubble universes? Daughter Universes? How

        many mulitple universes are out there if there are any?

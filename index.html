    <h3>Classwork 1</h3>
    
    <h4>What constitutes a creative web project today?</h4>
    <p>Looking at the given examples I found out that pretty much anything can be a web project. All these artist had different ideas and each one executed it differently.</p>
    
    <h4>How do each of you wish to employ the web or the internet as a creative platform?</h4>
    <p>I have been saying this for the longest but I would either like to make my own clothing brand, or help my family memebers with their ideas and exapnd their platform.</p>
    
    <h4>What are your goals in this course?</h4>
    <p>I know this sounds vague, but I do want to become better at coding. I took MEDP150 during the transistion from in person to online and feel that
      not only didn't learn much but dont really rember it at all.</p>
